# AI Debugging Assistant Prompt â€“ Python Screening Task 2

## Project Description
This repository contains the submission for FOSSEE Python Screening Task 2. The goal is to design a clear and supportive prompt for an AI assistant that helps students debug Python code. The assistant guides learners using questions, hints, and encouragement, but never provides direct answers or full code fixes.

## Files
- `TASK2.md`: The main task file with the prompt, reasoning, teaching method, adaptations for skill level, and submission checklist.

## How Does It Work?
The prompt is written so the AI acts like a helpful tutor. It begins by asking students what they expected their code to do, then guides them to spot their own mistakes through gentle questions and hints. The feedback is adapted for both beginners and advanced students.

## Usage
No code needs to be run. Just review the prompt and reasoning in `TASK2.md` as part of the screening task.
